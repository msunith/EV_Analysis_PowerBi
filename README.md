### Measures used
## Penetration Rate:
This metric represents the percentage of total vehicles that are electric within a specific region or category. 
It is calculated as:

Penetration Rate =  (Electric Vehicles Sold / Total Vehicles Sold) * 100  

   This indicates the adoption level of electric vehicles.
   
## CAGR- Compound Annual Growth Rate
CAGR is a measure of the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time longer than one year. 
It represents one of the most accurate ways to calculate and determine returns for anything that can rise or fall in value over time.

	CAGR = (Ending Value/Beginning Value) ^ (1/Number of Years) – 1

	Ending Value: The value of the investment at the end of the period.
	Beginning Value: The value of the investment at the start of the period.
	Number of Years: The total number of years over which the investment is held.
