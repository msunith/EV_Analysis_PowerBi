# EV_Analysis_PowerBi
created a PowerBI dashboard to provide strategic insights to an automotive company for launching electric vehicles (EVs) in the Indian market.
### Project Description:
**AtliQ Motors** is an automotive giant from the USA specializing in **electric vehicles (EV)**.
 In the last 5 years, their market share rose to 25% in electric and hybrid vehicles segment in North America.As a part of their expansion plans, they wanted to launch their bestselling models in India where their market share is less than 2%.
### Problem Statement:
Despite success in the North America , Atliq Motors has a minimal footprint in the Indian Market.
The primary challenge is to analyze the dynamics of the Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) market and pinpoint the key opportunities and potential threats.
### Data:
We have data on the sales of 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers for the fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024. Our analysis will focus on vehicle manufacturers and state-wise performance

### Measures used:

## Penetration Rate:
This metric represents the percentage of total vehicles that are electric within a specific region or category. 
It is calculated as:

Penetration Rate =  (Electric Vehicles Sold / Total Vehicles Sold) * 100  

   This indicates the adoption level of electric vehicles.
   
## CAGR- Compound Annual Growth Rate:
CAGR is a measure of the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time longer than one year. 
It represents one of the most accurate ways to calculate and determine returns for anything that can rise or fall in value over time.

	CAGR = (Ending Value/Beginning Value) ^ (1/Number of Years) – 1

	Ending Value: The value of the investment at the end of the period.
	Beginning Value: The value of the investment at the start of the period.
	Number of Years: The total number of years over which the investment is held.
